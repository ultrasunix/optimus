# OptimUS
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/optimuslib/badge/?version=release_edit)](https://optimuslib.readthedocs.io/en/release_edit/?badge=release_edit)

An open-source Python library for solving 3D acoustic wave propagation.

The OptimUS library provides functionality to simulate acoustic wave propagation in an unbounded domain with multiple scatterers. OptimUS solves the Helmholtz equation in multiple domains with homogeneous material parameters, using a boundary element method (BEM). The library targets general acoustical simulation and has functionality for focused ultrasound in biomedical engineering.

## Cautions:
- Replace the *method.py* file in the docker image by the *method.py* file in the GitHub version. The Docker version *method.py* file is located in ['/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/optimus']


## Installation

The OptimUS library and all dependencies are installed and tested in a Docker container. First, install the docker engine on your machine following the instruction on the [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) website. Then, pull the docker container by running:


```bash
docker pull optimuslib/optimus:latest
```


To start the container on your machine, run:


```bash
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/home/optimus/localwork --workdir /home/optimus/localwork -p 8888:8888 optimuslib/optimus:latest
```
The output will provide the URL and token to access the Jupyter notebook interface from a web browser.


Upon accessing Jupyter, you can execute the notebooks available in the `notebook` directory on this GitHub page.


If you want to get a bash terminal within the container, you can either launch one through the [Jupyter notebook interface](http://localhost:8888) or via Docker as:


```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/home/optimus/localwork --workdir /home/optimus/localwork optimuslib/optimus:latest 
```

In the terminal, you can execute your Python files by running:


```bash
python3 <file_name.py>
```

### Troubleshooting

Depending on the configuration of your machine's OS, you may need to adapt the above Docker commands.
- Some systems require running the above Docker commands as a super user. In a bash terminal use: `sudo docker` instead of `docker`.
- On Windows, PowerShell works best. Other shell environments may not detect `$(pwd)` as the current working directory and one needs to provide the full path, for example, `C:\Users\myname:/home/optimus/localwork` with the first part adapted to the path of your local folder to be detected in the Docker container.


## Documentation
Examples are available in the `notebook` directory on this GitHub page. Automatically generated documentation of the Python API
can be found in [Read the Docs optimus project](https://optimuslib.readthedocs.io/en/release_edit/index.html).


## Getting help
Enquiries about the library and questions should be asked on the [GitHub discussion page](https://github.com/optimuslib/optimus/discussions).
Errors in the library should be added to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/optimuslib/optimus/issues).
